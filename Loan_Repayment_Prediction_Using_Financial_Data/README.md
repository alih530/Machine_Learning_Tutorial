# Decision Trees and Random Forests Project

This project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forests for predicting loan repayment using financial data.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan repayment. It explores decision trees and random forests, highlighting their capabilities and differences.

## Features
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Insights into the dataset through visual and statistical analysis.
- **Model Building**: Implementation of decision trees and random forests.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy and feature importance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file to explore and execute the code.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations, model performance metrics, and feature importance for predictive modeling.
