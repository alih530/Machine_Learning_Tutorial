# USA Housing Price Prediction

This project is a demonstration of using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features of houses in the USA. The dataset includes demographic and housing-related data.

## Project Overview

Your neighbor, a real estate agent, wants to predict housing prices in the USA. This project aims to help her by building a model that takes certain features of a house and provides an estimate of its price.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `USA_Housing.csv` and contains the following columns:

- **Avg. Area Income**: Average income of residents in the house's area.
- **Avg. Area House Age**: Average age of houses in the area.
- **Avg. Area Number of Rooms**: Average number of rooms in houses in the area.
- **Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms**: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.
- **Area Population**: Population of the area.
- **Price**: Price of the house.
- **Address**: Address of the house.

### Project Workflow

1. Import necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (Price).
4. Build a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn` (for model building and evaluation)

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Place the `USA_Housing.csv` file in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook (`Creat USA_Housing.ipynb`) and run the cells sequentially.

### Results

The project demonstrates how Linear Regression can be applied to predict house prices. The model's accuracy and insights gained from the data analysis are detailed in the notebook.
