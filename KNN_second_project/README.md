# K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and implementing the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. KNN is a simple yet effective method for classification and regression tasks.

## Objectives
- Learn the working of the KNN algorithm.
- Implement this algorithm for classification problems.
- Analyze model accuracy based on the number of neighbors.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains code and analysis related to the KNN algorithm.
- **Data**: Includes datasets used for evaluating the KNN algorithm.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Set the number of neighbors parameter and execute all cells.

## Outputs
- Trained models using the KNN algorithm.
- Graphs and tables evaluating the model's performance.
