# Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and implementing **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** algorithms. These are popular machine learning techniques used for classification and regression tasks.

## Objectives
- Understand the functionality and principles of decision trees and random forests.
- Implement these algorithms to solve data analysis problems.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using various metrics.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Contains code and analysis related to the project.
- **Data**: Includes datasets used for training and testing the models.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `sklearn`

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Execute all cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Outputs
- Trained models using decision trees and random forests.
- Performance comparison and evaluation metrics of the models.
