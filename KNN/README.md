### About K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. Here's how it works:

1. **Training Phase**: KNN doesn't perform explicit training. Instead, it stores the training dataset to use during prediction.

2. **Prediction Phase**: 
   - For a given input sample, the algorithm calculates the distance to all the points in the training data.
   - It selects the 'K' nearest neighbors based on the smallest distances.
   - For classification: The most common class among these neighbors determines the predicted class.
   - For regression: The average of the neighbors' values is used to predict the output.

3. **Distance Metrics**: Commonly used metrics include:
   - Euclidean distance
   - Manhattan distance
   - Minkowski distance

4. **Applications**: KNN is widely used in:
   - Pattern recognition
   - Image classification
   - Recommendation systems
   - Data imputation

5. **Strengths**:
   - Simple and easy to implement.
   - Works well with small datasets.

6. **Weaknesses**:
   - Computationally expensive for large datasets.
   - Sensitive to irrelevant features and the choice of K.
