# K-Means Clustering Project
## Introduction to kmeans
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data grouping. It partitions data into a predefined number of clusters, where each cluster contains points with similar characteristics. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center (centroid) and updates the centroids based on the average position of the points in each cluster. This process minimizes the variance within clusters and maximizes the separation between them. K-Means is widely used in data analysis, customer segmentation, and image compression.

## Project Overview
 This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between the private nature of universities and other available data using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand how the privacy status of a university correlates with other variables in the dataset.
### steps
#### Import Required Libraries
First, we import the necessary libraries to handle data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
#### Load and Explore the Dataset
- Open the dataset file and read the data.
- Review the structure and description of the table to understand the attributes and their relevance.
#### Data Analysis
- Analyze the data to identify relationships between the privacy status of universities and other variables in the dataset.
#### Modeling 
- Fit a model to the data under two conditions:
1. Without normalization.
2. With normalization.
- It was observed that models relying on distances (e.g., K-Means, KNN) perform better with normalized data. Therefore, normalization is a crucial step before fitting these models.
